    CONSOLE APPLICATION : CheckersAlgorithm Project Overview
========================================================================

Russian checkers artificial intelligence algorithm. It is written on the basis of the alpha-beta pruning algorithm. The algorithm used on the site http://f0116700.xsph.ru/, what is russian checkers site.

Because the algorithm uses recursion, there have been attempts to reduce memory consumption. Information about checkers moves and is stored in bits. But instead of bit operations using multiplication and division by a power of two. This was done to cross-platform using and entertainment.

Stack and Queue classes on project was written to improve c++ coding skills.
